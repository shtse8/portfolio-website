  - **Crisp White:** A clean, bright background for clarity (e.g., `#FFFFFF`).
  - **Vivid Light Gray:** A neutral yet vibrant base (e.g., `#F0F0F0`).
  - **Electric Blue:** A dynamic blue that infuses energy (e.g., `#0099FF`).
- **Secondary Colors (30%)**
  - **Bold Charcoal:** Deep, dark gray for striking contrast (e.g., `#333333`).
  - **Modern Gray:** A sleek medium gray for balancing elements (e.g., `#7F7F7F`).
- **Accent Colors (10%)**
  - **Vivid Swedish Blue:** A reimagined, high-saturation blue (e.g., `#007AFF`).
  - **Bright Swedish Yellow:** A luminous yellow for energetic highlights (e.g., `#FFCC00`).
  - **Intense Swedish Red:** A powerful red to draw immediate attention (e.g., `#FF3B30`).

### 1.2. Dark Mode
- **Backgrounds:** Use deep, near-black shades (e.g., `#121212`) for optimal contrast.
- **Element Backgrounds:** Slightly lighter dark tones (e.g., `#1E1E1E`) to differentiate interactive elements.
- **Text Colors:** Crisp white or high-contrast light gray (e.g., `#FAFAFA` or `#E0E0E0`) for excellent legibility.
- **Accents:** Apply the same accent palette with moderated saturation to maintain visual comfort in dark environments.

### 1.3. Additional Color Considerations
- **Gradients:** Incorporate energetic gradients (for instance, transitioning from a deep electric blue to a lighter cyan) to add depth and dynamism.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure every color combination meets or exceeds WCAG AA/AAA standards (minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1).

## 2. Typography & Layout
### 2.1. Font Choices

      child: AnimatedContainer(
        duration: Duration(milliseconds: 250),
        curve: Curves.easeOut,
        width: isAdded ? 280 : 200,
        height: 50,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: isAdded ? Colors.green : Colors.blue,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            isAdded ? "Added to Cart" : "Add to Cart",
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
    ```
